Challenges: 

This one was tough because the tutorial was from so long ago that many of the CDN's and code snippets were deprecated. So following him isn't working.  The classes he's calling for aren't there, so I'm burning a lot of time troubleshooting.  And I guess that's kind of the point, to get better at problem-solving, but when I weigh time as a cost versus the payoff of these non-displayable projects...

Perhaps we'll come back and finish this one, but for now we move on. 

Future Development:
